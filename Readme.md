## How to use this action

This action helps you check pull request commits signatures for DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) and GPG verification

For default, GPG validation is disabled but you can easily change that using an environment variable:


e.g:
```sh
name: DCO GPG VALIDATOR
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  dco-gpg-validator:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: ZupIT/zup-dco-validator@v1.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          VALIDATE_GPG: true
```
